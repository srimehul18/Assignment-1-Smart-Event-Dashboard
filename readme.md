# Smart Event Dashboard

A simple JavaScript-based event management dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The project follows a todo-style approach for learning DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

- Add a predefined sample event
- Delete individual events
- Clear all events
- Responsive card-based layout using CSS Grid

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
- Events are created dynamically using JavaScript
- Each event is rendered as a card inside an unordered list
- Buttons trigger event listeners for add, delete, and clear actions
- No frameworks or libraries are used

## Project Structure
